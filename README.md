# Last Assignment 1

to get this working you'll need to 
1. pixi install
2. pixi run jupyter lab .

Both should be done from inside the folder.

In case this does not work. Go inside the folder, do:

`pixi add python jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

And then do `pixi shell` inside the folder, followed by `jupyter lab .` or more simply `pixi run jupyter lab .`.
